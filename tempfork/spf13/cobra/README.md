# github.com/spf13/cobra

This package contains a copy of the shell scripts that Cobra uses to integrate
tab-completion into bash, zsh, fish and powershell, and the constants that
interface with them. We have re-used these scripts to implement similar
tab-completion for ffcli and the standard library flag package.
